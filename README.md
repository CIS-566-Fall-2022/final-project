## Milestone 1

### Wenqing Wang

### Yuqi Zhang
Yuqiâ€™s Milestone 1:
I finished the rain and snow particle generation, for the rain effect, I also worked with the interaction with the particle to geometry. (Rain drops stick on the geometry surface, accumulate to and drops)
I started working with lightning and got basic shapes. I am still working on the color/light of the lightning.
